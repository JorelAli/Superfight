# Superfight Online
An online superfight game with help from my cousin, created in HTML, Node.js, AngularJS and CSS

[Superfight](https://www.superfightgame.com/) is a multiplayer card game about creating fighters and arguing with each other which one would win if they were to fight against one another

This project idea was created by myself when I remembered that Cards Against Humanity had an online system, however Superfight did not. By working with my cousin, we were able to create an online superfight game with game rooms to allow you to play with multiple people.

### The code
Here's the links to the main parts of the code which are worth looking at (The things we wrote together):
* The main Node.js server - [server.js](https://github.com/Skepter/Superfight/blob/master/Superfight/server.js)
* The Node.js & AngularJS client code which is executed - [client.js](https://github.com/Skepter/Superfight/blob/master/Superfight/client/Scripts/client.js)
* HTML & AngularJS page shown to clients - [index.html](https://github.com/Skepter/Superfight/blob/master/Superfight/client/index.html)
* The css formatting for the cards - [client.css](https://github.com/Skepter/Superfight/blob/master/Superfight/client/Content/client.css)
